## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Phase 1A Direct Read Core: `inspect_table()` and `read_schema()` — read-only
  inspection of one DBF table with no output files and bounded source reads
- Phase 1B streaming Direct Read: `iter_records()`, `read_records()`, and
  `iter_raw_records()` — typed streaming access with O(1) memory
- Field projection (case-insensitive, caller-selected order, unselected fields
  not parsed)
- Memo policies: `skip`, `null`, `lazy`, `inline` with explicit contract
- Raw forensic stream (`iter_raw_records`) preserving physical record bytes
- Typed, JSON-safe error model with stable machine codes
- Polish codepages cp1250 → cp852 → Mazovia fallback
- Phase 1 AFTER benchmark baseline recorded from GitHub Actions (24 MEASURED,
  PARTIALLY_COMPARABLE — legacy Phase 0 lacks storage/runner provenance)
- Structural CDX flag and DBC backlink metadata preserved

### Fixed
- VFP autoincrement semantics (field-flags mask 0x0C on Integer)
- FPT header validation (512-byte header record, nonzero block size)
- DBC backlink decoding with resolved encoding
- Companion discovery I/O error boundary

### Changed
- Development Status: Alpha (Direct Read Core stable, broader API stabilization continues)
- Python 3.14 CI support added
